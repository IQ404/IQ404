# Welcome to my Github!

### Hi, I'm Xiaoyang Liu

- currently a postgraduate student studying [Computer Game Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/degrees/5152f/) from Newcastle University
- BSc Physics from UCL

Here are what you might find on my Github (not much right now!):

- Usually I keep a [list of my notes](https://github.com/IQ404/Notes/blob/e3169a6a42ec8b294e48980b283e4fb663921220/README.md) (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) on what I have been studying from various resources.

- In my spare time, I studied an online course ([GAMES101](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html), Introduction to Computer Graphics) taught in Chinese by [Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/). [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied an online course ([GAMES202](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games202.html), Real-Time High Quality Rendering) taught in Chinese by [Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/). [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied [GAMES104](http://games-cn.org/games104/) (an online course on Modern Game Engine given by [BoomingTech](www.boomingtech.com), taught in Chinese). [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied an online course ([GAMES201](http://games-cn.org/games201/), Advanced Physics Engines) taught in Chinese by Yuanming Hu (the creator of 
the Taichi programming language). [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied Tom Looman's [Unreal C++ Course](https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp?coupon_code=COMMUNITY15). [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- I completed the course *CSC8502: Advanced Graphics for Games* from the Newcastle Game Engineering MSc. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- I completed the course *CSC8503: Advanced Game Technologies* from the Newcastle Game Engineering MSc. [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.
