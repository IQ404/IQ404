# Welcome to my GitHub!

### Hi, I'm Xiaoyang Liu, please see my [personal web](https://iq404.github.io/) for more.

## What you might find on my GitHub:

#### Rasterization

- // TODO: I'm planning to write a CPU-based rasterizer.
- An unfinished rasterized scene of [a wavy sea on a rainy day](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8502) //TODO: this project is aimed to be seriously polished.

#### C++

- A purpose-specific [polynomial solver](https://github.com/IQ404/Coursework-CSC8501) I wrote.

#### Algorithms

- A [binary search tree](https://github.com/IQ404/BinarySearchTree-CSC8501) I wrote.
- Some [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/IQ404/TheFastestSorter-CSC8501) I wrote.

#### Game AI (the Classical Ones)

- I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) (where my primary focus was on designing and implementing the AI for the boss behavior) with 7 other classmates during the Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University.
- An unfinished [football game](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) //TODO: this project is aimed to be seriously polished.

#### Games

- [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/MyFirstGame) is the first game I ever made.
