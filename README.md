### Hi, I'm Xiaoyang Liu

- currently a postgraduate student studying [Computer Game Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/degrees/5152f/) from Newcastle University
- BSc Physics from UCL

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/xiaoyang-liu-642b74aa) or [Steam]().

ðŸ”¥ **Here are what you might find on my Github:** (not much right now!)

- I am currently writing a [ray tracer](https://github.com/IQ404/8599-ray-tracer) for my MSc module CSC8599.

- I usually write [notes](https://github.com/IQ404/Notes) on things I learned seriously.

- *Stuffs I did related to my Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University:*

  - I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) with 7 other classmates.

  - I completed the course *CSC8503: Advanced Game Technologies* from the Newcastle Game Engineering MSc.
  
    [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) is the final project I did for this course.
  
  - I completed the course *CSC8502: Advanced Graphics for Games* from the Newcastle Game Engineering MSc.
