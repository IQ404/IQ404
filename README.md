## What you might find on my GitHub:

#### Ray Tracing

- I wrote a series of [CPU-based ray tracers with a denoiser](https://github.com/IQ404/cpu-based-ray-tracer).

#### Rasterization

- A bunch of [shaders](https://github.com/IQ404/learning-opengl) together with an OpenGL application I wrote.
- // TODO: I'm planning to write a CPU-based rasterizer.
- An unfinished rasterized scene of [a wavy sea on a rainy day](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8502) //TODO: this project is aimed to be seriously polished.

#### C++

- A purpose-specific [polynomial solver](https://github.com/IQ404/Coursework-CSC8501) I wrote.

#### Algorithms

- A [binary search tree](https://github.com/IQ404/BinarySearchTree-CSC8501) I wrote.
- Some [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/IQ404/TheFastestSorter-CSC8501) I wrote.

#### Game AI

- I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) (where my primary focus was on designing and implementing the AI for the boss behavior) with 7 other classmates during the Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University.
- An unfinished [football game](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) //TODO: this project is aimed to be seriously polished.

#### Games

- [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/MyFirstGame) is the first game I ever made.
