- Stuffs related to my Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University:

  - I am currently writing a [ray tracer](https://github.com/IQ404/8599-ray-tracer) for the module CSC8599.

  - I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) with 7 other classmates.

  - I completed the module *CSC8501: Advanced Programming for Games*.
    
    [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/Coursework-CSC8501) is the code I wrote for the coursework of this module.
    
    During this module, I wrote a [binary search tree](https://github.com/IQ404/BinarySearchTree-CSC8501) and some [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/IQ404/TheFastestSorter-CSC8501).
  
  - I completed the module *CSC8502: Advanced Graphics for Games*.
  
    [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8502) is the project I did for this module.
  
  - I completed the module *CSC8503: Advanced Game Technologies*.
  
    [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) is the project I did for this module.

- [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/MyFirstGame) is the first game I ever made.
