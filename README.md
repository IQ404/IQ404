# Welcome to my Github!

### Hi, I'm Xiaoyang Liu

- currently a postgraduate student studying [Computer Game Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/degrees/5152f/) from Newcastle University
- ~~Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Advanced Studies (Advanced) in Mathematics and Statistics from University of Sydney~~
- BSc Physics from UCL

## ðŸ”¥ Here are what you might find on my Github (not much right now!)

- // TODO: Study Notes!

- I worte a series of [CPU-based ray tracers](https://github.com/IQ404/cpu-based-ray-tracer).

- I have done a [team project](https://github.com/blacktack2/MastersGroupProject2023) with 7 other classmates studying Computer Game Engineering MSc at Newcastle University.
    
- An incomplete [polynomial solver](https://github.com/IQ404/Coursework-CSC8501) (incomplete because currently it can only be used to solve for polynoimals with specific restrictions)
    
- I wrote a [binary search tree](https://github.com/IQ404/BinarySearchTree-CSC8501).

- Some [sorting algorithms](https://github.com/IQ404/TheFastestSorter-CSC8501) written by me.
  
- An unfinished rasterized scene of [a wavy sea on a rainy day](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8502) (this project is aimed to be seriously polished).
  
- An unfinished [football game](https://github.com/IQ404/FinalProject-CSC8503) (this project is aimed to be seriously polished).

- [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/MyFirstGame) is the first game I ever made.
