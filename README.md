# Welcome to my Github!

- [What's on this github?](#githubcontents)

### Hi, I'm Xiaoyang Liu<a name="intro"></a>

- currently a postgraduate student studying [Computer Game Engineering MSc](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/degrees/5152f/) from Newcastle University
- BSc Physics from UCL

There are far too many things in life I love: from mathematical logic to tennis, from philosophy to music... I love paintings but I don't know how to draw, so I'm trying to learn to let the computer draw for me; I love physics but NPR and techniques in non-physical rendering actually interest me most...

### Here are what you might find on my Github: (not much right now!)<a name="githubcontents"></a>

- Usually I keep a [list of my notes](https://github.com/IQ404/Notes/blob/main/README.md) (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) on what I have been studying from various resources (there's even notes on tennis... ).

- In my spare time, I studied an online course ([GAMES101](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html), Introduction to Computer Graphics) taught in Chinese by [Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/).
  
  [Here](https://github.com/IQ404/GAMES101-works/blob/main/README.md) (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done.
  
  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied an online course ([GAMES202](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games202.html), Real-Time High Quality Rendering) taught in Chinese by [Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/).
  
  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done.
  
  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done.
  
  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied an online course ([GAMES201](http://games-cn.org/games201/), Advanced Physics Engines) taught in Chinese by Yuanming Hu (the creator of 
the Taichi programming language).

  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- In my spare time, I studied Tom Looman's [Unreal C++ Course](https://courses.tomlooman.com/p/unrealengine-cpp?coupon_code=COMMUNITY15).
  
  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) are the graphics I rendered from the homework I've done.
  
  [Here]() (currently private ðŸ˜Ÿ will be made public soon... ) is the final project I did for this course.

- I completed the course *CSC8502: Advanced Graphics for Games* from the Newcastle Game Engineering MSc.
